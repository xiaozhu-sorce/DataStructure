Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. I am very glad to have this opportunity to share the charm of communication with you.
Communication is a bridge and plays a important role in connecting within people. The whole world becomes better because of communication.
Communication makes life more beautiful. In our daily life, only through communication can we know what others think and get to know each other. As long as we open our hearts to each other and communicate actively, not only can we learn from others' advantages, but also discover and correct our own shortcomings in time.
Communication makes the soul more beautiful. As communication promotes the relationship between people, it also helps people solve problems more reasonably and effectively. Communication makes people merge, makes people happy, and also makes people sparkle of love.
Communication can also make nature more beautiful. All creatures in nature are alive, and they are also communicating with each other. With the north wind, the leaves fall on the ground, into the soil, then become a precious fertilizer of nature. The fish swim in the water, they are intimate with the ocean.
Let us broaden our horizons, actively communicate, and make our lives more exciting!
This is my speech.Thank you for your attention.
